Description
-----------

An alternative to SRFI-9 Records:
* basically a dictionary data structure,
* with fields (for each instance) and methods (shared between instances),
* but no inheritance etc.

The main purpose was:
* concise member addressing -- using OO-style instance 'scope/namespace',
instead of the comparatively verbose member addressing of records.

Language: Scheme R5RS.
